The purpose of this project is to create a simple game of resource gathering.

The game will be tile based, and players will accrue steps on an interval to explore.

Vision will be limited because it is dark.

Idlers can gather resources, or hide in objects while idling to attack passersby for an attack bonus.

Gear will increase defence, technology will increase visibility and levels will unlock more steps per interval.
